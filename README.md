# Snake-Game

## Accessing Application

The app is embedded as a React Component on my website and can be accessed by visiting: [navjotchahal.com/#/projects](https://navjotchahal.com/#/projects)

## Overview

Snake game is a React-based app that is similar to the world-famous Snake game present in old Nokia phones.

The app used a javascript array instead of a simple CSS grid and hence has greater control over each block rendering and thus, is highly customizable.

## Motivation

For my decision to learn JavaSript I wanted to take a project which went very deep into the language's core concepts and could accelerate my learning of new syntax. I also wanted it to be loaded as a component in my main website built with react so I made this app in react framework.

### Key Challenges and Learnings:
I encountered and overcame the following key challenges when developing this application.
1. Coming from a compiler-based C++ background it was difficult to adapt to JavaScript syntax for 2D array manipulation but I was able to adapt very efficiently.
2. I wanted to make the App fully modular and did not hard code any key components so that anyone can modify the app, later on, to add more functionality without changing everything.
3. The main object of getting used to JavaScript syntax was achieved as I had to refer to the JavaScript manual a lot and thus, I learned the latest ES6+ syntax practically.
4. Many small concepts like keyboard event handling, lifecycle functions, State hooks, and intervals were used as well.
5. I wanted to save the high score in the backend database, so learned to implement Firebase's Firestore to store high score.

## Future Contributions
This project was developed as a learning project but still will receive future updates to add user-selectable game modes.
